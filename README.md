# CI
This is a demo repo where I've used the cloud9 to build a python scaffold with makefile, test, lint and used GitHub Actions for continuous integration

To connect github(through SSH) and cloud9 need to generate rsa key. Use this command and get the public key, add it to the Github ssh
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```
The CI/CD pipeline
